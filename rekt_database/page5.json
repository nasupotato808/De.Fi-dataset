This allowed him to transfer funds directly into his wallet. The exploit was carried out in several transactions. After acquiring the funds, the attacker used the Tornado Cash mixer to hide the traces of the stolen funds. This method of obscuring the origin of funds makes it difficult to track the attacker.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Malicious Transactions:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x57c61df91e46b191424bfdd9223f277457a07999b58420e3b540059aad3fc7fe</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x10d245e61e76c7bf44257985789463ed89f624a0d5ffc45cfa671b16a7113d77</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0763afe207015ed7c1aa8858d2c092cf7b6a20397f2408bff20b044ef1901822</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf94de5a083f16700f4d26ec8ca3e03dc01889a54f472bf630079c54a77f033e6</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x18e0efcaabe64299666fd78bb33dae2a4b25c6f11b469fc0498db714970cacfa</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x744c51b4544c76be384197a8c089271dfcbd207d67bad6d2f8907dd7d4d852e5</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9c75f70670d94e6d37f60a585f9b57d13193998d64866f720489efbea4809056</p><p><br></p><p>Tornado Cash Mixer Transaction:</p><p>https://bloxy.info/txs/calls_from/0x079667f4f7a0b440ad35ebd780efd216751f0758?signature_id=11062&amp;smart_contract_address_bin=0xa160cdab225685da1d56aa342ad8841c3b53f291</p>",
