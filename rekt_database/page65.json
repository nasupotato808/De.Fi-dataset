Instead, the user's normal Kakao SDK JavaScript file request was connected to a third-party server built by the attacker, which was not a Kakao server, that led to an incident in which malicious code files were downloaded.</p><p><br></p><p>The malicious JavaScript allowed the attackers to intercept funds as a user-initiated transaction. Over a two-hour period, the hackers stole cryptocurrency totaling 2.2 billion won (about $1.9 million) from 407 abnormal transactions from 325 customer wallets.</p><p><br></p><p>The attackers changed all transaction requests of users to either directly send or approve the user's token to their contract and load it on the KLAYswap site. By changing the Kakao SDK script, the malicious code was created in the form of interfering with the operation of the existing KLAYswap code and allowing its own code to be executed. If a transaction occurred with corrupted logic, the user's assets were approved for use or the assets were transferred directly to the attacker's address.</p><p><br></p><p>KLAYswap developers say they blocked all functions of KLAYswap and performed an emergency check to prevent further damage after the incident was identified. They also restricted the operation of Klaytn minter, a blockchain platform in the bridge, to prevent the transfer of stolen assets to other exchange platforms through the Orbit Bridge.</p><p><br></p><p>South Korean cybersecurity firm S2W analyzed the attack and found that the malicious code was distributed only to users who accessed it through KLAYswap by checking the referrer value of the HTTP header when connecting.

The attack was carried out in three transactions, with one of them being a whitehat who managed to rescue approximately 25% of the total amount taken. The exploit was made possible due to a previously known bug that had not been properly patched. Saddle Finance is an AMM that focuses on stable swaps of assets that are pegged or similar in nature. It uses concepts from Curve, which has two distinct swap pools: Standard and Meta. The Meta pool allows liquidity in one pool to be used in additional pools. The root cause of the attack on Saddle Finance was the inconsistent price calculations of assets within its Meta pool. The mispricing was caused by the omission of math that calculates the value of tokens given, based upon the base virtual price of the LP token. The bug was present within the library called MetaSwapUtils, which is used for calculating swaps, deposits, and withdrawals. Despite the protocol's quick reaction to the exploit and the migration to a supposedly fixed MetaSwapUtils library, the incorrect swap calculation present in the original code was still present in live pools.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Exploit TXs:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b023d65485c4bb68d781960c2196588d03b871dc9eb1c054f596b7ca6f7da56</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe7e0474793aad11875c131ebd7582c8b73499dd3c5a473b59e6762d4e373d7b8</p><p><br></p><p>Exploiter:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x63341ba917de90498f3903b199df5699b4a55ac0</p>",

This process has been repeated multiple times. The ZEED tokens are directly added or subtracted from the balance of the trading pair, which creates a vulnerability that the hacker exploits. This vulnerability allows the hacker to increase the balance and receive excess rewards from the pair. The attack leverages the ZEED contract's direct calculation of the balance using the rewardFee but not using the separate calculation of zedreward, horward, usdtreward. This vulnerability is used to generate profits for the hacker. The total amount of funds stolen is estimated at $1,043,070.

This resulted in a rapid drop in the token's price by approximately 90%. The deployer took advantage of their ability to manipulate the liquidity pool and market to execute a rug pull, effectively stealing funds from investors. The exploit highlights the importance of careful token contract design and the need for investors to perform due diligence before investing in new projects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Deployer:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xb0b86e33d9e0f847e3600fc2ad6b357652c19ec7</p><p>Remove liquidity:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0054d2be3295cd7ec5896374f27ad0f3c8aa4d11557912949b6869a7b94710a9</p>",
