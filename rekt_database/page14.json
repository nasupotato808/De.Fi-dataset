They borrowed WBNB from seven different PancakeSwap pools and USDT from Fortube Bank, deposited a portion of these funds into the WBNB+BUSDT pool and swapped a large amount of WBNB for BUSDT. This manipulation allowed them to claim a reward of 6.97M BUNNY, valued at about $1B, from VaultFlipToFlip.
