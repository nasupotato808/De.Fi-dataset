They then deposited the dYdX flash loan into the UniswapV2 pair (WETH-DAI), minting 94.349K LP tokens in return. These tokens were transferred to WarpVaultLP as collateral. The attacker then swapped 341K WETH for 47.6M DAI via UniswapV2, causing DAI to become very expensive and doubling the LP token price. With the inflated LP token price and collateral value, the attacker was able to borrow 3.86M DAI and 3.9M USDC from WarpFinance, totaling about $7.8 million. The attacker then returned the flash loans to dYdX and UniswapV2.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Smart contract used in the attack:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf8bee861227ffc5eea819c332a1c170ae3dbacb</p><p><br></p><p>Transactions involved in the attack:</p><p>https://ethtx.info/mainnet/0x8bb8dc5c7c830bac85fa48acad2505e9300a91c3ff239c9517d0cae33b595090</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8bb8dc5c7c830bac85fa48acad2505e9300a91c3ff239c9517d0cae33b595090</p>",2020-12-18,7800000,5800000,1,Borrowing and Lending,Flash Loan Attack,WARP,0xed40834a13129509a89be39a9be9c0e96a0ddd71

This allowed the exploit contract to use those LP tokens as collateral for borrowing crypto assets from Cheese Bank<br><br>- raised the CHEESE price at UniswapV2 by swapping 20k ETH to 288k CHEESE, making the UNI_V2 LP tokens more valuable as collaterals Cheese Bank. This is the crucial step in this incident since the Cheese Bank uses the amount of WETH in a liquidity pool to estimate the price of the corresponding LP token. The manipulated UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH pool (with 20k+ WETH) allowed the attacker to drain all the USDC, USDT, and DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by legit <u>borrow</u>() calls<br><br>- refreshed the price feeds of Cheese Bank. The attacker intentionally invoked the <u>CheesePriceOracle::refresh</u>() function to refresh the price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token which is derived from the amount of WETH in the liquidity pool and the ETH price derived from the UNI_V2-USDT-ETH pool. Specifically, the <u>CheesePriceOracle::fetchLPAnhorPrice</u>() function gets the <u>wEthBalance</u> of UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH contract. With the passed in <u>ethPrice</u>, the <u>totalValue</u> is derived by<u>&nbsp;wEthBalance x 2 x ethPrice</u>. Therefore, the unit price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token is computed by <u>totalValue / totalSupply of LP tokens</u>. It means if the attacker could somehow increase the amount of WETH in a pool (e.g., <u>addLiquidity</u>() with flash loan ether), the price of the LP token would be increased<br><br>- drained the USDC, USDT, DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by <u>borrow</u>() calls.

They then used these stablecoins to mint OUSD from the Origin Protocol's vault. The attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the mint function of the OUSD contract to mint more OUSD than the equivalent stablecoin collateral in the vault. This resulted in the attacker holding more OUSD than the total value in the vault. The attacker then exchanged the excess OUSD for USDT and DAI on Uniswap and SushiSwap, and withdrew the remaining stablecoins from the OUSD vault.

The second batch was sold 18 times for 20 ETH each, also in Kyber that, after internal consulting of reserves, routed the swap orders to the Kyber-sUSD reserve (0x4cb01bd05e4652cbb9f312ae604f4549d2bf2c99) and got 63,584 sUSD in return. The sell-off of these two batches effectively drove the price of sUSD up to 0.00899 ETH (or 1ETH=111 sUSD).

As bZx relies on Kyber for the price feed, with the spiked sUSD/ETH price, the collection of &gt;1M sUSD allows for the borrow of 6796 ETH.

The smart contracts for Eminence were deployed without announcement and quickly discovered by the community. Users could deposit DAI into the smart contract and receive EMN in return. EMN could be exchanged for five other tokens (eAAVE, eLINK, eYFI, eSNX, and eCRV). The attacker exploited these contracts by taking out a flash loan for 15 million DAI from Uniswap and used this to buy EMN. He then traded and burned half this EMN for eAAVE, driving up EMN’s price. He then traded the rest of his EMN for DAI, traded his eAAVE to mint more EMN and then finally traded this EMN for DAI. This process was repeated three times to net the hacker 15,015,533 DAI. 8M DAI were returned back to the Yearn deployer.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x223034edbe95823c1160c16f26e3000315171ca9</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3503253131644dd9f52802d071de74e456570374d586ddd640159cf6fb9b8ad8</p><p><br></p><p>Returned DAI Transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7bc97357364222207f1f011b22ad98ba78fcd3c25d3398346caa3928cdf4a4dd</p>",2020-09-29,15113001,8000000,1,Gaming / Metaverse,Flash Loan Attack,EMN,0x5ade7ae8660293f2ebfcefaba91d141d72d221e8

They return 2 uint values, the first one being an error code. So, after the swap, they were unable to call these functions on the new interest rate contracts, as the signatures do not match.

2689,Squid Game,"<p><strong>Quick Summary <br></strong></p><p>The Squid game project has been rug pulled by its team by way of blacklisting users from selling the $SQUID token. Investors were collectively alleviated of approx. $ 5,7 million.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Squid game project was inspired by the hit Netflix show and promised to be a play to earn game, hereby resembling the actions in the series. The hype surrounding the Netflix show combined with the increased interest in crypto due to the bull market incentivized big news outlets such as BBC and CNBC to write about the rapid surge in price of the new $SQUID token. Retailers around the world pushed the price from $0,01 to $2,861 in little over a week. CoinMarketCap published a warning concerning this project from the start as early investors reported that the sell of the token on pancake swap was not possible. A look at the smart contract revealed that all 3 contracts: SQUID, Marbles, and MasterChef were upgradable. Meaning the contract deployer would change the mechanisms of the project at will.<br>For example a new MasterChef made it possible for the 0x71 EOA to withdraw all tokens from the MasterChef contract at the following transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf7c9d0e5a81999f9e06fe78df7ce41da112d8bd4f2da7b16cfdbbe46c92cb6af</p><p>The Squid game project boasted two token. The $Marbels token was required in order to be eligible to sell $SQUID on the open market. $Marbles were not tradable on the market and could only be obtained by participating in the game with an entrance fee of $SQUID 456. Meaning at the all time high price of the SQUID token a withdrawal would have costed at least $1,3 million.</p><p>The contract deployer also blacklisted all users that did not hold Marble's token to prevent from selling SQUID in this transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b82e96fccaa9ccc3255b509df51d127aa7ad402624f07683855d0e1c4555041</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Involved EOA addresses:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x71d934aa2119ca3995f702f075d540f7a6b0f728<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x1f5eabba9c56bca4a7828969b79bc87051125b31<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>0x32 invoked the internal protocol's contract which worked as the interface of the PancakeSwap pair contract to sell SQUID tokens at multiple transactions under the ""0x5c2a8729"" method:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65<br><br>Example of <span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: ""Open Sans"", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>""0x5c2a8729""&nbsp;</span>transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x98a07fde52914566a72b7eeb2ec1b1af3cb9a0a1d817bb1fb8d6d204993ae96a<br><br>The WBNB recipient was EOA, marked as SQUID Token Rug 2, which then deposited stolen funds into Tornado Cash Proxy:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa<br><br>2 unverified smart contracts were used to sell SQUID tokens:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x95eb532f23a97191324103755332a3dff97d722f<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x5b871670d4f1d81591ecf641588a28f5032c9dcd</p>",2021-11-01,5723268,0,2,Gaming / Metaverse,Rugpull,"SQUID, Marbles","0x87230146E138d3F296a9a77e497A2A83012e9Bc5, 0x9531c509a24ceec710529645fc347341ff9f15ea"

The reason is that someone might save your signed listing (which are public - i.e https://orders.rarible.com or even their API) and use it later, even if the listing got removed from the UI<br><br>- the transaction on-chain will save the fact that you canceled this sale on their smart contract and even if someone will try to use your signed data from before, the on-chain validation will reject the sale<br><br>- the bug stems from the fact that previously you could re-list an NFT without canceling it and all the previous listings are not canceled on-chain, this is why re-listing will not work<br><br>For example, at around 7 am on January 24, a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT #9991 was purchased for 0.77 ETH ($1,800). This family of NFTs currently sells for at least $198,000. Twenty minutes later the hacker sold the NFT for 84.2 ETH ($196,000) – realizing a profit of $194,000.<br><br>One attacker, going by the pseudonym ""jpegdegenlove"" paid a total of $133,000 for seven NFTs – before quickly selling them on for $934,000 in ether.

What happened was this: a player won a load of bitcoins on the site and asked to withdraw them, dooglus paid out, but forgot to remove the balance from the user’s Just-Dice account. The user then gambled — and lost — the bitcoins that were left in his account and dooglus covered the loss out of his own pocket.<br><br>When he realized his mistake, dooglus contacted the user, who claimed he had left his laptop in a café and that someone else logged onto his Just-Dice account and gambled the money.</p>",2013-07-15,123000,0,,Token,Access Control,,

The Elrond team paused the work of Maiar DEX, they also froze stablecoins so that the hacker would not be able to withdraw funds through the bridge to another network.

3058,Terra Classic,"<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>A complex mixture of events and market dynamics cost the implosion of the $40b Terra (Classic) Network.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The Terra Luna Network was focused on its two native coins $LUNC and $USTC. $USTC was the algorithmic Stablecoin that was supposed to hold the peg to 1$ and $LUNC functioned as the satellite asset that absorbed $USTC’s volatility. This was achieved through a mint and burn functionality as well as by arbitrage which the former function inherently enabled.</p><p><br></p><p>$USTC rose to prominence in rapid fashion even surpassing $DAI in market cap. The Luna Foundation Group decided to start a new Curve4pool with $FRAX, $USTC, $USDC and $USDT as assets, excluding $DAI in an attempt to starve the most used StableCoin pool used by institutions the Curve3pool on the Ethereum network.</p><p><br></p><p>The migration of $USTC from the Curve3pool is the event that started the bankrun. In early May, the Luna Foundation Guard withdrew 250 million $USTC from the Curve3pool in preparation for the Curve4pool. Simultaneously, a handful of whales withdrew sizeable amounts from the anchor protocol, a crypto savings bank. The biggest wallet withdrew 347 million $USTC in total and bridged funds to the Curve3pool in order to swap for other assets. This movement of funds created an imbalance between $USTC and other Stablecoins in the pool, resulting in devaluation of $USTC on exchanges.</p><p><br></p><p>As a result of the tokenomics of $USTC and $LUNC the firesale of $USTC resulted in uncontrollable minting of the $LUNC token and a rapid fall in valuation. Additionally, the Terra network went down due to overload in transaction as market participants were panicking and trying to answer margin calls within the Anchor protocol. Eventually massive liquidations of collateral in the Anchor protocol would be incurred by investors.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Whale Addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d47f08ebc5554504742f547eb721a43d4947d0a</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x4b5e60cb1cd6c5e67af5e6cf63229d1614bb781c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x1df8ea15bb725e110118f031e8e71b91abaa2a06</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xeb5425e650b04e49e5e8b62fbf1c3f60df01f232</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x41339d9825963515e5705df8d3b0ea98105ebb1c</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x68963dc7c28a36fcacb0b39ac2d807b0329b9c69</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f705ff1da72ed334f0e80f90aae5644f5cd7784</p>",2022-05-08,40000000000,0,22,Stablecoin,Other,"LUNC, USTC","0xa47c8bf37f92abed4a126bda807a7b7498661acd,0x7e43d25EaD96B1058f671F6690ea705BA2C7e5B9"

The attacker purchased INV tokens and manipulated the price to overestimate its value. This allowed the attacker to borrow 1588 ETH, 94 WBTC, 3999669 DOLA, and 39 YFI, which significantly exceeded their initial INV investment. The attacker deployed a malicious smart contract and used SushiSwap and Curve.fi to manipulate the price. Due to the small liquidity of SushiSwap on the INV/ETH pair, an exchange for 300 ETH was enough to change the price of the INV token. The attacker then deposited the funds in INV received at the preparation stage and minted 1746 XINV tokens. With the rise in the price of XINV, the attacker was able to borrow assets using the minted XINV tokens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Exploiter Addresses:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b4c1083cd6aef062298e1fa900df9832c8351b3</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x117c0391b3483e32aa665b5ecb2cc539669ea7e9</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract Address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xea0c959bbb7476ddd6cd4204bdee82b790aa1562</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x20a6dcff06a791a7f8be9f423053ce8caee3f9eecc31df32445fc98d4ccd8365</p>",2022-04-02,14500000,0,1,Borrowing and Lending,Oracle Issue,INV,0x41D5D79431A913C4aE7d69a668ecdfE5fF9DFB68
3062,Horizon by Harmony,"<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Harmony's Horizon Bridge was exploited by an attacker resulting in losses of roughly $100M.

This hack was made possible by an operational error incurred by the team, which had been found and commented upon in an audit report made by Quantstamp. Essentially, at the initialization of the contract the ""process()"" function checks messages for an acceptable merkle root. The team accidentally marked the zero root (0x00) as acceptable. This error enabled every message to be auto-proven by default. Essentially, the attacker was able to process transactions without any proving by calling the function ""process()"".</p><p>This information spread within the community and all that was needed to participate in the looting of the protocol was finding a transaction that worked and copy-pasting the transaction with the wallet of desire at the receiving end.

This exploit was made possible through validators' usage of outdated oracle software.</p><p><strong><br>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>The Mirror Protocol was a synthetic assets protocol that allowed users to deposit $USTC or $LUNAC with a lockup period in order to mint synthetic stocks and commodities. It is noteworthy that the new Terra Network was launched within days after the collapse of the Terra Classic Network. The protocol suffered an exploit in the amount of $2 million caused by outdated oracle price feeds. The price feeds used the price of the new Luna Coin instead of the LunaC. While the new Luna coin was trading at a price around 5$ at the time, the $LUNAC coin was practically worthless at a price point of fractions of a cent. This meant that for $1k in $LUNC an attacker could deposit $1,3 million in deposit and borrow against it.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Due to this mechanism, attackers drained several pools on the platform.</p><p><br></p><p style=""margin:0cm;background:white;""><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Example Transaction: https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/F830681D8FEACC4DA67E84D40C49F0FF805609F2BB5CCC39A0EFE66257F2D791</p>",2022-05-31,2000000,0,22,"Borrowing and Lending,Other",Oracle Issue,MIR,"https://etherscan.io/address/0x09a3EcAFa817268f77BE1283176B946C4ff2E608, https://bscscan.com/address/0x5B6DcF557E2aBE2323c48445E8CC948910d8c2c9, https://finder.terra.money/classic/address/terra15gwkyepfc6xgca5t5zefzwy42uts8l2m4g40k6"

The team used $DAI 6 million pledged to their vault in order to invest into a Kronos chain based stablecoin called Kairos Cash in the pursuit of higher yields for its investors. This change in investment strategy was not communicated beforehand and the various transactions to the Binance central exchange made the redirection of investment strategies even less transparent.

Due to security issues of the project's smart contracts, an attacker was able to manipulate the price of the $DDC token.

The hack was made possible by a logical vulnerability that allowed the attacker to exploit the transfer function, which gave them twice the rewards if the sender and recipient were a pair.</p><p>The attacker exploited the vulnerability by obtaining a 1,400 WBNB flash loan before exchanging 1,000 WBNB for 10.5K BRA tokens. They then transferred all the acquired BRA tokens to the Pancakeswap pair. Next, they used the ""skim()"" function and invoked the BRA contract's transfer function to receive rewards. The ""skim()"" function acts as a recovery mechanism if the number of tokens supplied to a pair exceeds the two uint112 storage spaces for reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>In this case, the attacker provided the pair as the recipient address, and BRA reverted to the pair, resulting in the doubling of the BRA amount after a single skim. The attacker repeated this method 100 times, which led to a significant increase in the contract pair's BRA balance.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacker then returned 1.675K WBNB tokens and repaid the 1.4K WBNB token flash loan, which generated a profit of 675 WBNB that was sent to their address.

The root cause of the vulnerability was because the NUM token was incompatible with the Multichain, a cross-chain router protocol. The NUM token lacked a permit function required by the Router protocol, but it did have a default callback function which allowed forged signature to be passed in to trick the cross-chain bridge into transferring the user's assets. The attacker created a fake token using the attack contract which used $NUM as its underlying token, then called the anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit function of the Multi-Chain Router contract to drain 557,754.45000198 $NUM tokens from one of the victim users. This function should generally pass in token, and call the permit function of the underlying token for signature approval, before exchanging the token of the authorized user to the specified address. In this case, since the $NUM token contract didn’t have a permit function, but it did have a callback function, which means that when an attacker sent in a fake signature, the callback function would return normally, so the transaction wouldn't fail. Eventually, this allowed the $NUM token at the victim address to be transferred to the specified attack contract. The attacker then used Uniswap to convert the stolen $NUM tokens into $USDC and then into WETH. The attack was front-run by a bot, which paid the builder approximately 10 ETH out of the entire profit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker TX:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8a8145ab28b5d2a2e61d74c02c12350731f479b3175893de2014124f998bff32</p>",2022-11-23,13836,0,1,NFT,Other,NUM,0x3496b523e5c00a4b4150d6721320cddb234c3079

The attack was carried out in three transactions, with one of them being a whitehat who managed to rescue approximately 25% of the total amount taken. The exploit was made possible due to a previously known bug that had not been properly patched. Saddle Finance is an AMM that focuses on stable swaps of assets that are pegged or similar in nature. It uses concepts from Curve, which has two distinct swap pools: Standard and Meta. The Meta pool allows liquidity in one pool to be used in additional pools. The root cause of the attack on Saddle Finance was the inconsistent price calculations of assets within its Meta pool. The mispricing was caused by the omission of math that calculates the value of tokens given, based upon the base virtual price of the LP token. The bug was present within the library called MetaSwapUtils, which is used for calculating swaps, deposits, and withdrawals. Despite the protocol's quick reaction to the exploit and the migration to a supposedly fixed MetaSwapUtils library, the incorrect swap calculation present in the original code was still present in live pools.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Exploit TXs:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b023d65485c4bb68d781960c2196588d03b871dc9eb1c054f596b7ca6f7da56</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe7e0474793aad11875c131ebd7582c8b73499dd3c5a473b59e6762d4e373d7b8</p><p><br></p><p>Exploiter:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x63341ba917de90498f3903b199df5699b4a55ac0</p>",2022-04-30,11000000,2500000,1,Exchange (DEX),Other,SDL,0x88cc4aa0dd6cf126b00c012dda9f6f4fd9388b17

A malicious validator exploited a vulnerability in the MEV-Boost Relay and drained five MEV bots. Attack Vector starts from the exploiter to trigger MEV bots to buy already prepared tokens from UniV2 pools. Consequently, the validator executed transactions, front-running the bots. When the MEV bot tries to take profit, the attacker sets both the parent root and state root to zero of the block, making it impossible for the block to be accepted by the network after being signed correctly by proposers. As a result, they could take revealed transactions from deconstructed bundles and claim liquidity from unlucky MEV bots included in that block. Approximately, 26,123,300 $USD worth of $WETH, $WBTC, $USDT, and $DAI were siphoned out from the affected contracts.</p><p>The patch was rolled out shortly after this incident where now mev-boost-relay will refuse to return transactions if blocks are not successfully sent into networks. In addition, there is now an added delay of one second before responding with any transaction data.</p><p>Further investigation led to evidence suggesting malicious actors three EOA addresses funded just 25 days ago were used as part of planning and preparing various token pools. Three out of five affected bots had their entire balances drained due to automated strategies working against them when bought tokens without regard for price impact.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xf489bd7bc0589ae10c6dd7f39eb429f3aace746e</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious block:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/txs?block=16964664</p><p><br></p><p>Contract holding funds:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x3c98d617db017f51C6A73a13E80E1FE14cD1D8Eb</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x5B04db6Dd290F680Ae15D1107FCC06A4763905b6</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x27bf8f099Ad1eBb2307DF1A7973026565f9C8f69</p><p><br></p><p>Draining transaction example:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa34d79cbe9aef1bf07692885b353d85912523dfc4662611d33dd09ff6c319c85</p>",2023-04-02,26123300,0,1,Other,Other,,"0x00000000008c4fb1c916e0c88fd4cc402d935e7d,0x000000000035b5e5ad9019092c665357240f594e,0x00000000003b3cc22af3ae1eac0440bcee416b40,0xe8c060f8052e07423f71d445277c61ac5138a2e5"

The attacker used two associated accounts to execute the exploit. The attacker added margin to these two accounts and gradually established large opposite positions for option BTCUSD-40000-C for both accounts by trading relatively small volumes for each turn.

With everlasting options’ funding mechanism, Account A continuously paid funding fees to B which pushed up the positive net volume causing higher funding rates making it likely that Account A would get liquidated unless BTC price kept going up. At UTC time 10/28/2022 17:51 when BTC price went down and brought Account A under maintenance margin it got liquidated causing massive sell notional=100,192.4024 $BTC which dragged mark price below zero leading to a loss of around $144k USD but only lost original balance as opposed to full loss due bound by margin balance.</p><p>Immediately after liquidation of A; the attacker closed out short position in B resulting in large profits for 144,532 $USDC.</p><p>The pool ended up with a net loss since although theoretically B’s profit came from A’s loss but since losses were bound by margin balances and could not be fully realized thus resulted in negative PnL.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker addresses:</p><p><span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: ""Open Sans"", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>https://arbiscan.io/address/</span>0x09ca80536f5aa6f04a8170D44aAf9fdfDD1e228d</p><p><span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: ""Open Sans"", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>https://arbiscan.io/address/</span>0x2443506117e03136727E394F85B5b0797A3E0477_</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc31ade492c134388fef8fdd7669c9bb195c1426697c418d27d45ce9a837bc93d</p>",2022-10-28,144532,0,5,Exchange (DEX),Other,,0xde3447eb47ecdf9b5f90e7a6960a14663916cee8

The protocol experienced a hack due to a price manipulation attack on the Optimism layer-two chain. The attacker deployed malicious smart contract with unverified source code, and then donated 200 $WBTC to inflate hWBTC's exchange rate so that even a tiny amount (2 wei) of $hWBTC could drain current lending pools. The attacker then borrows 500 $WBTC from Aave and deposited into the pool and borrowed funds from all pools because of the inflated price of $hWBTC. Consequently, 500 $WTBC was redeemed back for nothing, which caused the attacker contract being liquidated. This resulted in 6,701,157 $USD worth of cryptocurrency being drained from their lending pools. The hacker bridged over 1,034 $ETH valued at 2,180,000 $USD on the day of transfer along with other cryptocurrencies such as USDC and USDT via Multichain and swapped them for various tokens including DAI, FRAX, PAXG among others. 919,224 $USD worth of $sUSD and $SNX remains at the attackers original address at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x155da45d374a286d383839b1ef27567a15e67528</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transactions:</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6e9ebcdebbabda04fa9f2e3bc21ea8b2e4fb4bf4f4670cb8483e2f0b2604f451</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io//tx/0x15096dc6a59cff26e0bd22eaf7e3a60125dcec687580383488b7b5dd2aceea93</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contracts:</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x978d0ce23869ec666bfde9868a8514f3d2754982</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x284abd14f54125064b7bcc3b9be84931fa5c9aac</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xd340f2208edbbbeca4fe4893d76eaaa5711e702b</p>",2023-04-15,6701157,0,,Borrowing and Lending,Oracle Issue,,"0x35594e4992dfefcb0c20ec487d7af22a30bdec60,0x10e08556d6fdd62a9ce5b3a5b07b0d8b0d093164,0x371cb7683bA0639A21f31E0B20F705e45bC18896,0xd97a2591930E2Da927b1903BAA6763618BD7425b,0x0145BE461a112c60c12c34d5Bc538d10670E99Ab,0x76E47710AEe13581Ba5B19323325cA31c48d4cC3,0xb994B84bD13f7c8dD3af5BEe9dfAc68436DCF5BD"

The root cause of the issue is due to the protocol's inability to handle flashloans of ERC677 tokens properly. The attacker used a flashloan to borrow the underlying token, which was then deposited into the protocol via a callback function controlled by the attacker. This resulted in lots of extra f tokens being minted. The borrowed token was then returned to the protocol via a flashloan callback, but lots of fTokens were left to the attacker, allowing them to redeem most of the cash in the lending pool.

After stealing these tokens from multiple users' wallets on the Polygon network using this method they swapped them for around 20 $ETH and transferred it to their initial address.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:</p><p>https://polygonscan.com/address/0x11576cb3d8d6328cf319e85b10e09a228e84a8de</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xa0480d0f7c8d8bf898cadde954e773ddc3740f1ffa31cdd98fe4c5f5d8266243</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract Address:</p><p>https://polygonscan.com/address/0x43623b96936e854f8d85f893011f22ac91e58164</p>",2023-05-22,36362,0,3,Other,Other,LFI,0xe6e5f921c8cd480030efb16166c3f83abc85298d

3691,Balancer,"<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong></p><p>Balancer V2 liquidity pools were exploited via a flash loan attack resulting in a loss of 1,898,586 USD worth of stablecoins.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Balancer, an AMM-based DEX running on multiple chains including Ethereum, Optimism, and Fantom, was exploited on August 27, 2023. The attacker exploited the Balancer V2 liquidity pools in multiple transactions via a flashloan attack. They took a flash loan from Aave and used the loaned funds to exploit Balancer's smart contracts. Balancer had made their users aware of the vulnerability on January 6, 2023, and mentioned that they started the mitigation process. On August 22, 2023, they disclosed that they had mitigated over 80% of the funds, while 4% of Balancer's TVL was still at risk. Users were advised to withdraw affected LPs immediately. The stolen funds in all three affected chains were swapped for DAI and then bridged to the mainnet. The funds were transferred to other EOAs that are currently holding the funds as of August 29, 2023. The total loss was 1,898,586 USD worth of stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, and DAI. This included 1,000,377 USD from Ethereum, 221,855 USD from the Optimism chain, and 676,354 USD from the Fantom chain.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attackers:</p><p>- https://etherscan.io/address/0xEd187F37E5Ad87d5b3B2624C01dE56C5862b7a9B</p><p>- https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xbc794f1ff9ad7711a9d2e69be5b499e290b8fd3c</p><p>- https://ftmscan.com/address/0x64e08fa89c2bae9f123cc8a293775f0e6cc86760</p><p><br></p><p>Funds Holders as of Aug 28, 2023:</p><p>- <span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65);

On September 5, 2023, the project's referral system was exploited. The attacker took advantage of a vulnerability that allowed them to place ""Ghost"" bets on a game, which were registered as losses, and thus enabled the claiming of 5% of these ""Ghost"" bet losses.

By controlling the majority of liquidity in the PAX Gold (PAXG) pool, the attacker deposited 10 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) as collateral in a smart vault and borrowed the maximum amount of EUROs without getting liquidated.

A vulnerability in the smart contract allowed the attacker to manipulate token swap ratios and execute a profitable sandwich attack. The attacker exploited the BvaultsStrategy contract's convertDustToEarned function, which relied on the current balance of the `wantToken` token. By manipulating the ALPACA/WBNB pool and invoking the convertDustToEarned function, they artificially inflated the swap ratio, resulting in a loss of approximately $768,358 worth of assets. The exploiter then swapped the stolen BUSD to WBNB via 1inch, sent it to another EOA, and deposited it into TornadoCash. The Bearn team sent an on-chain message to the attacker, requesting a refund of a portion of the stolen funds to reimburse affected users.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xCE27b195Fa6dE27081a86b98b64f77F5FB328dd5</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x51913be3f31d5ddbfc77da789e5f9653ed6b219a52772309802226445a1edd5f</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious Contract Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0xe1997bC971D5986AA57Ee8ffB57eb1DeBa4fDAaa</p><p><br></p><p>Onchain Message from BearnDAO Team:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xc0300811fc489424dfdceca537d0d015b0f75b6a9485e56b02d6a818e5cdc942</p><p><br></p><p>TornadoCash Deposit Transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x25892a61d0e1d37688d05cf5687dd1e44195f7c690a2ed0aefa9231ed5070904</p>",2023-12-06,768363,0,2,Other,Other,,0x21125d94cfe886e7179c8d2fe8c1ea8d57c73e0e

This enabled the attacker to manipulate the price up to the threshold and generate an unusually high number of LP tokens. The attacker revealed a flaw in the deposit proxy configurations, specifically targeting stable and LST vaults.

The attacker manipulated the price of underlying assets, specifically the WETH/USDC pair on the Camelot Router. By taking a flash loan of approximately 4500 WETH and depositing it with the Camelot LP, the attacker was able to manipulate the WETH/USDC.E pool pair. They then called the redeem function from the CITRedeem contract to get huge amounts of WETH from the treasury with a low amount of CIT. Approximately 30.95 CIT tokens were burned, and the attacker took away assets worth 21.326 WETH. The flash loan was repaid, and the attacker was able to retain the excess funds as profit.

Blockchain analysts at Cyvers Alerts reported anomalous transactions originating from wallets allegedly associated with AAX, a crypto exchange under scrutiny following FTX's bankruptcy. The transactions, totaling over $55.5 million worth of ETH, purportedly aimed at laundering funds through decentralized exchange (DEX) platforms like UmbraCash and 1inch, with some funds being routed to the TRON blockchain via SwftCoin. Analysts noted patterns indicative of attempts to circumvent anti-money laundering measures, including blacklisting by Tether Inc. Meanwhile, AAX's operational suspension, announced on November 14, 2022, for data proofreading and restoration, underscores the exchange's challenges.

The breach, attributed to unknown malware infiltrating Fang's password manager, affected connected wallets, including the multisig wallet for Remilia's funds. Assets were sold for around 850 ETH, nearly $3 million. Despite this, Fang assured that NFT ownership and the operating treasury were secure. The organization has no immediate plans to sell NFTs, minimizing impact on budgeted operations. The crypto community, skeptical of Fang's claims, prompted investigation by Web 3 security experts like Peckshield. This incident follows controversy in September, where Fang disclosed a misappropriation of $1 million from the treasury and faced accusations of misusing $1.7 million, leading to a lawsuit and removal due to alleged dissemination of extremist content.

The breach was due to vulnerabilities within the Balancer-style CPMM pool contract, particularly faulty logic in the velocore__execute() function and issues with the fee rate calculation logic that allowed effectiveFee1e9 to exceed 100%. Additionally, there was a potential underflow issue during single-token withdrawals and a lack of caller verification in the velocore__execute() function. The attacker used funds from Tornado Cash, executed the exploit, bridged the funds through Across Bridge, and redeposited them back into Tornado Cash. While all volatile pools in Linea and zkSyncEra Velocore were affected, stable pools and the Telos Velocore pools were not impacted as the issue was mitigated beforehand. The Blade fork of Velocore, which uses a different pool structure, was also unaffected. The team acknowledged the critical assistance from Hexagate, Hypernative, and Ironblock in identifying and addressing the exploit. Further updates and a detailed post-mortem are forthcoming.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Final Fund Destination Address:&nbsp;</p><p>0xe4062fcade7ac0ed47ad794028967a2314ee02b3</p><p>Exploiter EOAs:</p><p>0x8cdc37ed79c5ef116b9dc2a53cb86acaca3716bf</p><p>0xd8c465ecd8c6f1a0c114890f1ef553f82e59d274</p><p>Exploiter Contracts:</p><p>0xed4e130f6f9e68918996f7e1e46a3306b3e12cec</p><p>0xb7f6354b2cfd3018b3261fbc63248a56a24ae91a</p><p>0xc030fba4b741b770f03e715c3a27d02c41fc9dae</p><p>0xf7f76b30a301524fe76508546B1e3762eF2B9267</p><p>Attack txs:</p><p>https://lineascan.build/tx/0xed11d5b013bf3296b1507da38b7bcb97845dd037d33d3d1b0c5e763889cdbed1</p><p>https://lineascan.build/tx/0x37434e674efc4e7cfeed7746095301ace5636028906fe548b786ead286e35eb0</p><p>https://explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x4156d73cadc18419220f5bcf10deb4d97a3d3f7533d63ba90daeabc5fd11ba17</p><p><br></p>",2024-06-02,6800000,0,47,Exchange (DEX),Other,,

The vulnerability resided in the depositToGasZipERC20 function within the GasZipFacet.sol contract. This function allowed the _swapData parameter to be passed directly to LibSwap.swap, which included a low-level call that could execute arbitrary functions. Since the attacker had control over _swap.callTo and _swap.callData, they were able to craft malicious calldata with transferFrom() calls. With sufficient token spending approval, the attacker executed unauthorized transferFrom() calls to siphon funds from the protocol. Li.Fi has advised users to revoke approvals for specific addresses and has disabled the affected smart contract facet to contain the exploit. This incident is particularly notable as it echoes a similar $600,000 loss in 2022 due to the same bug in the protocol’s swapping feature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x7742ed59e9ecf1712bc4c6bdd0c526e903a7f2c8</p><p><br></p><p>Vulnerable contact</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xf28a352377663ca134bd27b582b1a9a4dad7e534#code</p><p><br></p><p>Attack tx:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd82fe84e63b1aa52e1ce540582ee0895ba4a71ec5e7a632a3faa1aff3e763873</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x65a92b189e4ae0b8a8a02cd59c5e9f6832586bd5167d41a24eb4f4d2ac692755</p>",2024-07-16,8000000,0,"1,47,51",Exchange (DEX),Other,,"0x1231deb6f5749ef6ce6943a275a1d3e7486f4eae,0x341e94069f53234fE6DabeF707aD424830525715"

The attacker managed to drain the funds by first compromising the signers' Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and subsequently changing the implementation of the Multisig. The attack began with a specific transaction (Etherscan link), where the attacker executed a delegate call from the compromised multisig to a proprietary contract deployed eight days earlier. The delegate call data was 0x804e1f0a000000000000000000000000ef279c2ab14960aa319008cbea384b9f8ac35fc6, which modified the slot 0 of the multisig proxy to point to the new proprietary contract. Tools like evm.storage confirmed that before the attack, slot 0 contained the standard safe implementation, and afterward, it pointed to the attacker's contract. Further analysis showed that after the implementation modification, all transactions to the Safe Multisig redirected delegate calls to the new address, which simply transferred assets to the attacker.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xd967113224c354600b3151e27aaba53e3034f372</p><p><br></p><p>Attack tx:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x48164d3adbab78c2cb9876f6e17f88e321097fcd14cadd57556866e4ef3e185d</p>",2024-07-18,230000000,0,1,CeFi,Access Control,,

The attacker initiated the attack by taking a flashloan and borrowing USDY tokens from Minterest's flashLoan function, which triggered their fallback function, allowing them to manipulate the market’s exchange rates. This manipulation resulted in a lower cash balance for the market. When Minterest's contract called the attacker's fallback function, the attacker converted USDY tokens to mUSD and reentered the Minterest contract via the lendRUSDY function, exploiting the modified exchange rate to receive excess mTokens. The attacker then withdrew the underlying tokens, causing Minterest to burn some mTokens but retain the excess. Repeating this process multiple times, the attacker accumulated an estimated $1.7 million in mTokens in the mUSDY market, which they used to borrow WETH and mETH, ultimately draining $1.4 million from the protocol.

The vulnerability was traced to the claimMultipleStaking function in the CvxRewardDistributor.sol contract, specifically the cvxRewardCount parameter. This function failed to validate the staking contracts listed in the claimContracts array, allowing the attacker to manipulate the reward distribution process. The attacker deployed a malicious contract with a function signature matching claimCvgCvxMultiple, used to process reward claims. By including their malicious contract in the claimContracts array, the attacker tricked the claimMultipleStaking function into calling it as if it were a legitimate staking contract. This exploit enabled the attacker to mint 58 million CVG tokens intended for staking emissions.

In the first instance, the attacker used 59.9 ETH as collateral to borrow 1.18 WBTC. The _repayAmount variable was not validated, allowing the attacker to use a malicious contract to transfer borrowed WBTC without initiating a repayment check, sending it to another address.</p><p><br></p><p>The second flaw involved the claimReward() function. This function accepted arbitrary external contract addresses for reward claims, which the attacker exploited by passing a malicious contract through the pair parameter. This contract manipulated the internal balances of DeltaPrime, deceiving the protocol into paying out additional rewards. Specifically, the attacker’s contract triggered the wrapNative() function, converting ETH collateral into WETH, which then appeared as a rewardable balance. This trick allowed the attacker to extract 59.9 ETH as rewards.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of cashing out, the attacker chose a novel strategy, reinvesting the stolen assets across DeFi platforms on Avalanche. This included $600K staked in USDC via Stargate, $518K in liquidity for USDC/USDT pairs, 4,865 AVAX staked, 49.68 WETH.e, and 6.34 BTC.b.

The key weakness was in the ChainlinkUniV2Adapter, which relied on spot prices without adequate validation. The attacker exploited this weakness by executing a flash loan of 269,042 BOO and 1,154,788 BOO tokens from Spooky V2 and Spooky V3 liquidity pools, significantly reducing the token reserves in those pools and causing an abnormal price spike for the BOO token.</p><p><br></p><p>Using this inflated price, the attacker deposited a single BOO token as collateral in Polter's lending pool. Due to the flawed oracle system, the value of this 1 BOO token was calculated at an astronomical $1.37 trillion instead of its true market value. The platform's smart contract failed to detect this discrepancy because the price validation checks within the _fetchPrice and getRoundData functions were inadequate, allowing the manipulated price to go unchallenged.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacker repeatedly leveraged the inflated price of the BOO token to borrow wFTM tokens, ultimately draining a total of 9,134,844 wFTM from the lending pools.

A particularly large transfer of 14 million OM was identified, further fueling speculation of insider involvement. Although Mantra co-founder JP Mullin denied any wrongdoing and claimed centralized exchanges liquidated OM margin positions irresponsibly, blockchain data suggests otherwise. The OM token had recently undergone changes in emissions and tokenomics, which may have enabled early investors or insiders to unlock and sell significant volumes.
