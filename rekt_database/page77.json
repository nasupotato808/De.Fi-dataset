The Infini team did not halt withdrawals, with CEO Christian Li stating they would fully compensate losses if needed. The attack occurred just days after Bybit’s record-breaking $1.4 billion hack, raising further concerns about security in the crypto space. On-chain analyst ZachXBT has yet to attribute the attack to a specific group, but suspicions remain on insider involvement, making this another example of the risks associated with centralized control over smart contracts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Exploiter <br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ac96134fb0e42a52d33045aee50b89790f05ed0</p>",

Approximately $4 million in crypto was stolen, including 113 ETH, 923 WETH, 301 ezETH, 156 weETH, 90 pufET, 48,400 MASK tokens, 50,000 USDT, and 15 swETH. After being stolen, the assets were immediately converted into ETH, then distributed across six wallets, with one address ending in “df7.” Yan suggested the attack might have been an offline exploit, possibly carried out when his phone was left unattended at his birthday celebration, indicating potential physical access or phone compromise. Currently, SlowMist and ZachXBT are assisting in the investigation, alongside law enforcement. This incident follows a series of high-profile hacks, including the Bybit breach just days earlier, highlighting the increasing sophistication of cyber threats in the crypto space.</p>",

This inflated value allowed the attacker to mint excess ZeUSD far beyond their actual backing. After minting, they burned the ZeUSD to withdraw the falsely recorded collateral, ultimately profiting $285,000.
