        "description": "<p>Affected contract:<br>https://etherscan.io/address/0x53773fE5ff4451c896127Dd2c91b8dE7ac51Ba2C<br><br>Timeline:<br><br>Nov 27 05:21. The dydX team received a report from a member of a trading firm regarding a vulnerability in the dYdX deposit proxy contract.<br><br>Nov 27 06:40. The dYdX team confirmed the bug. They asked samczsun and Georgios from Paradigm to join them in the war room as they respond to the vulnerability.<br><br>Nov 27 06:50. The dYdX and Paradigm teams together decided the best course of action is to execute a white-hat hack of vulnerable funds to move them to a safe location.<br><br>Nov 27 07:33. As samczsun finished a proof of concept for a white-hat hack, the dydX began implementing the recovery flow in the frontend and implementing a bot to save any additional funds that become vulnerable.<br><br>Nov 27 08:01. The dydX determined that ~700 addresses had allowances set on the vulnerable proxy contract. Of these, about 180 had funds at risk, totaling ~$2M.<br><br>Nov 27 09:27. The dydX team asked Etherscan to remove the verified source code from the proxy contract and they made the source code on GitHub private.<br><br>Nov 27 10:33. The white-hat escrow contract was deployed.<br><br>Nov 27 10:56. The <u>setAllowance</u>() function was disabled in the dYdX exchange frontend.<br><br>Nov 27 12:04. The first white-hat hack was executed via flashbots.<br><br>Nov 27 12:22. The front end was updated to show the warning and recovery process to users affected by the bug. Allowances for deposits were re-enabled using the old deposit flow.<br><br>Nov 27 12:32. Announcement was made on Twitter and Discord:<br>https://twitter.com/dydxprotocol/status/1464572467872247815?s=20<br><br>Nov 27 12:43. The second white-hat hack was executed via flashbots for two more addresses.<br><br>Nov 27 13:16. A recovery bot was deployed to automatically retrieve and escrow any more funds that become vulnerable.<br><br>As of Dec 8 at 18:00 UTC, $533,000 of additional funds were rescued by the bot, and nearly 80% of affected addresses have revoked approval from the vulnerable contract. Another estimated $211,000 in funds were exploited by frontrunner bots.</p>",

Only days before the migration a developer on the team hardcoded the maximum fees on the crv and mim pool contracts to 17%. The developer also introduced a malicious smart contract that enabled the deployer to hardcode users balances. &nbsp;The exploiter proceeded to assign an enormous balance to his account, far exceeding the TVL of Bent Finance. <span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>Subsequently, the developer launched a new smart contract in order to cover his tracks.
