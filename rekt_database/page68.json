The project's Governance was exploited via malicious proposal. On May 20th, 2023 Tornado Cash governance ceased to exist as an attacker granted themselves over 1.2 million fake votes through a malicious proposal. With full control of governance, they could withdraw all locked votes and drain tokens from the contract or brick the router. The attack was sophisticatedly designed by using various tricks like combining CREATE/CREATE2 to create a contract with different bytecode and hiding intent behind emergencyStop() named function while updating proposal logic to grant themselves fake votes. Once gaining control, the attacker drained various contracts and users staking assets as $TRON tokens. The stolen tokens were swapped for $ETH and 360 $ETH was transferred through TornadoCash, while 120.4 $ETH remains at the attacker's address along with 177,340 $USD worth $TORN tokens. Consequently, over 500,000 $TORN tokens were used by the attacker to propose the 21st proposal, which seemingly may return the protocol control back to the users.

Consequently, multiple swaps with a small amount of 5,000 $USD was continuously repeated to manipulate the pool's price. After reaching some conditions, the attacker could swap the $CS tokens back with an unfairly high price and the total amount gained back went to 80,954,285 $USD. 240,000 $USD were paid back to the BSC-USD pool as a flash loan fee after the base amount was returned. The exploiter's profit reached 714,285 $USD, which was transferred to the initial EOA, and then distributed between several addresses. All the malicious actions were performed in a single transaction.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x2cdeee9698ffc9fcabc116b820c24e89184027ba&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x906394b2ee093720955a7d55bff1666f6cf6239e46bea8af99d6352b9687baa4&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x90fa57d23b85cdd52c46b85636f44c47926ee2e3&nbsp;</p>",

This allowed the attacker to modify the ABep20Delegate implementation to include a backdoor, enabling the transfer of users' assets to their control. The attacker currently controls approximately $1,161,848 worth of funds, while the rest stolen funds are at the attacker's initial address.

Another EOA address, suspected to be owned by the same deployer, altered the implementation of the UniTroller contract, sending 49,000,000 $GB tokens to the deployer. Consequently, the deployer drained a substantial amount of liquidity from the SushiSwap pool in a single transaction, receiving 47,825 $USD. The stolen amount was then moved through multiple addresses post-incident, resulting in a total loss of approximately 75,239 $USD.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Deployer Address:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/address/0xe5df114758a9beb76050754e35766191c0976a6a</p><p><br></p><p>Unitroller Admin Address:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/address/0x946c72b432f1d0c35d9b2c9454905cb84cc0d188</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity Removal Transaction:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xdaac092ff1d1d2c89ad97673c8ccab9c8bad16691c59b42df56a56d1369f8694</p><p><br></p><p>Liquidity Drain Transaction:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xfbd863d39f85d8a84326b14c00f4fc09302b6ad5e2a0e4cb39b34802dc56b492</p><p><br></p><p>Unitroller Malicious Implementation:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/address/0xfa8221438b5dC055dA5F7EC9fC87132edd2835ae</p><p><br></p><p>Unitroller Address:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/address/0x537A09Fd99Fc7eF737d297cDEeAB3b7f9602308c</p><p><br></p><p>Tokens Transfer Transaction:</p><p>https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xdd12c8ef4acb6233eb4a7625f473c0a41c15633712f497cd831952d6c3d623eb</p>",
