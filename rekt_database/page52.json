The hype surrounding the Netflix show combined with the increased interest in crypto due to the bull market incentivized big news outlets such as BBC and CNBC to write about the rapid surge in price of the new $SQUID token. Retailers around the world pushed the price from $0,01 to $2,861 in little over a week. CoinMarketCap published a warning concerning this project from the start as early investors reported that the sell of the token on pancake swap was not possible. A look at the smart contract revealed that all 3 contracts: SQUID, Marbles, and MasterChef were upgradable. Meaning the contract deployer would change the mechanisms of the project at will.<br>For example a new MasterChef made it possible for the 0x71 EOA to withdraw all tokens from the MasterChef contract at the following transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf7c9d0e5a81999f9e06fe78df7ce41da112d8bd4f2da7b16cfdbbe46c92cb6af</p><p>The Squid game project boasted two token. The $Marbels token was required in order to be eligible to sell $SQUID on the open market. $Marbles were not tradable on the market and could only be obtained by participating in the game with an entrance fee of $SQUID 456. Meaning at the all time high price of the SQUID token a withdrawal would have costed at least $1,3 million.</p><p>The contract deployer also blacklisted all users that did not hold Marble's token to prevent from selling SQUID in this transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b82e96fccaa9ccc3255b509df51d127aa7ad402624f07683855d0e1c4555041</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Involved EOA addresses:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x71d934aa2119ca3995f702f075d540f7a6b0f728<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x1f5eabba9c56bca4a7828969b79bc87051125b31<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>0x32 invoked the internal protocol's contract which worked as the interface of the PancakeSwap pair contract to sell SQUID tokens at multiple transactions under the \"0x5c2a8729\" method:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65<br><br>Example of <span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>\"0x5c2a8729\"&nbsp;</span>transaction:<br>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x98a07fde52914566a72b7eeb2ec1b1af3cb9a0a1d817bb1fb8d6d204993ae96a<br><br>The WBNB recipient was EOA, marked as SQUID Token Rug 2, which then deposited stolen funds into Tornado Cash Proxy:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa<br><br>2 unverified smart contracts were used to sell SQUID tokens:<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x95eb532f23a97191324103755332a3dff97d722f<br>https://bscscan.com/address/0x5b871670d4f1d81591ecf641588a28f5032c9dcd</p>",
