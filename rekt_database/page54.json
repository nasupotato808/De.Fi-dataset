The reason is that someone might save your signed listing (which are public - i.e https://orders.rarible.com or even their API) and use it later, even if the listing got removed from the UI<br><br>- the transaction on-chain will save the fact that you canceled this sale on their smart contract and even if someone will try to use your signed data from before, the on-chain validation will reject the sale<br><br>- the bug stems from the fact that previously you could re-list an NFT without canceling it and all the previous listings are not canceled on-chain, this is why re-listing will not work<br><br>For example, at around 7 am on January 24, a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT #9991 was purchased for 0.77 ETH ($1,800).

QBridgeHandler should receive the $WETH token, which is the original <u>tokenAddress</u>, and if the person who performed the tx does not have a $WETH token, the transfer should not occur.<br><br><u>tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom</u>(depositer, address(this), amount);<br><br>In the deposit function above, <u>tokenAddress</u> is 0, so <u>safeTransferFrom</u> didn’t fail and the deposit function ended normally regardless of the amount value. Additionally, <u>tokenAddress</u> was the $WETH address before <u>depositETH</u> was added, but as <u>depositETH</u> is added, it is replaced with the zero address that is the <u>tokenAddress</u> of ETH.<br><br>In summary, the deposit function was a function that should not be used after <u>depositETH</u> was newly developed, but it remained in the contract, which allows the attacker to use this to steal the funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xD01Ae1A708614948B2B5e0B7AB5be6AFA01325c7</p>",

        "description": "<p>On January 11, scammers staged one of the largest NFT scams in the history of the Solana blockchain. The scammers made off with 9,136 SOL, or about $1.3 mln, in funds sent by would-be collectors to mint the Big Daddy Ape Club NFT. The owners of the Big Daddy Ape Club project were able to abscond with funds despite the fact that the NFT drop was \"verified\" by decentralized identity verification company Civic. Civic now says it's working with law enforcement to find those responsible for the scam.<br><br>The Big Daddy Ape Club was introduced as a collection of 2,222 monkey-themed NFTs to be minted on the Solana blockchain and listed on the Solanart NFT marketplace.<br><br>Mert, a software engineer at Coinbase and a Solana researcher said he traced the Solana scammer's wallet, and that some of the funds were transferred to accounts on the Binance crypto exchange. The exchange said it has suspended the accounts and will also be working with law enforcement to investigate.<br><br>The address behind the case:<br>https://solscan.io/account/C2JoNvhfh4WYLUzDDE4YFeqsMQT3UrexJKfARA1JYYmw</p>",

This gave them access to all funds which they promptly withdrew. They then proceeded to remove liquidity from the contract. The funds were then transferred to the hacker's external wallet. A part of the stolen funds was also transferred to another external wallet. The DEGO team has attempted to contact the hacker but it is unclear if they have been successful. The exploit affected multiple chains including BSC, Cronos, and Ethereum.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Hacker's Address:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/address/0x118203b0f2a3ef9e749d871c8fef5e5e55ef5c91</p><p><br></p><p>BSC Transfers:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x37c471f849f66d2001a045da41bf2465995c1553e056fcaf420bc05abfe7fa3e</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x586dcc853a9f467bfbfb0179bc8199c4a01c4dd8f196501fae10b9e74e178ae6</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x62dc9b35dba773de6574442c3f4a214f8e4f9de52b4dc927a210882ed08ab4b6</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xe5dfcbc6b9be40a1588495d199e2268edda0fee3e2c658d9dbefcfbbcb069e67</p><p><br></p><p>BSC Liquidity Removals:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x8c1747c97ed1cc5134da0dde2afe7d562d975aed31eae13170216cafdcad84d6</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xc7f88c860f1cf2452957e665842d195caecebf51452c4a0b3678a495acd8e288</p><p><br></p><p>BSC Withdrawals:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa4fc71b3acc513f709ece8c0511beb1754dd18ba9f597cbdebdf6de11a43245f</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xfe67e929a208305b75507c742276738b8c02db7b0c0664a0fe3cf7717ac8e7f8</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xfa8ed0fefa5917485855873f9d1cf0b7129a4864253861347d2ee1203ea1442f</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4ba4809cfb1d3c3845602c38fc019e90fbff77e7f3aa6a00ac7386aa5c93290d</p><p><br></p><p>Transfer to External Wallet:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0xdf5762c24d3cded5070f344b380a87786f69d62e2db6b40e7c83afbc5db4ec67</p><p><br></p><p>Cronos Address:</p><p>https://cronoscan.com/address/0x118203b0f2a3ef9e749d871c8fef5e5e55ef5c91#tokentxns</p><p><br></p><p>Ethereum Transfers:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3beef4cc3b3ab8a51638e1853d27ee1dea798b9014a98aa568791f2d1e1a08cc</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x73529e7f15d7fd56c1906db2de09dc5707fe069f8b2a9b6812d102f02bb50995</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0e9dde956f8b1685e2ffd4478651d1c10d0ec1ceca140875fe768a909b2d671f</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x62e10626f4b1477a9ae2e90266acf60dda228b597b1bbaf823f5d87ec3ae7272</p><p><br></p><p>Ethereum Withdrawals:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0092b3573778522cffc117cc46352f54574ff5450c9fcd44718951fbcf326233</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5855a0c1205cb765c20c5b2f1639c7ec7475e65d9dea83a0ca22dc1de902cf63</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbabb03a9129739da5d5c020bec191f21cfd80ea5a2532cdc730696ec81385fa7</p><p><br></p><p>Ethereum Tornado Deposits:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x152f91e24332bc47dcd1e50a034664a040e10b6055b35f86b430b51e62fa5a2f</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0c84d2c6c4fdfc61ca08f1c49f89fc982362f6a41a981986abadac3568a771dd</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x59dc8303669025a4918bc55f46acd7d9eaea6ea9a9fb115c54ffff8fedbc8e3a</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x59871d498700923d6a7df582b4d3d0402e50c13fd9ccfa9f668c726dc453fb73</p><p><br></p><p>Transfer to External Wallet:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf837e753f0842efee8dac6f225458de453b0a7b7bd3aa2455c166a0a293be350</p><p><br></p><p>DEGO Team's Attempt to Contact Hacker:</p><p>https://bscscan.com/tx/0x065fa8782312e9786a458fc2345f4c7ef49267630c7f90a900999ce45ae4ced5</p>",

On February 8, 2022, an attacker exploited Superfluid’s host contract by passing in faulty calldata, which allowed them to create distribution indexes spoofing several different accounts that held Super-tokens. This vulnerability enabled the attacker to move funds from Superfluid user wallets to exchanges on Polygon and swap them to ETH. The funds currently sit in the attacker’s wallet.</p><p>In total, 11,008 MATIC, 1,507,931 MOCA, 28 ETH, 39,357 sdam3CRV, 19,387,874 QI, 44,581 SDT, 23,653 STACK, and 562,834 USDC were stolen by the attacker. At the time of writing, over 2,700 ETH is sitting in the attacker’s wallet, as well as 500,000 MOCA.<br><br><u>callAgreement</u>() function was exploited by replacing the bytes memory callData parameter. This parameter contains ctx value which can be decoded to get such properties: timestamp, msgSender, agreementSelector, userData, appAllowanceGranted, appAllowanceWanted, appAllowanceUsed, appAddress, appAllowanceToken. Ctx was replaced with the fake one, so the attacker was able to drain all SuperToken contract funds.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong><br>Attacker address:<br>https://polygonscan.com/address/0x1574f7f4c9d3aca2ebce918e5d19d18ae853c090</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transaction:<br>https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x396b6ee91216cf6e7c89f0c6044dfc97e84647f5007a658ca899040471ab4d67</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contract:</p><p>https://polygonscan.com/address/0x32d47ba0affc9569298d4598f7bf8348ce8da6d4<br><br>Claim transaction:<br>https://polygonscan.com/tx/0xdee86cae2e1bab16496a49b2ec61aae0472a7ccf06f79744d42473e96edd6af6</p>",
