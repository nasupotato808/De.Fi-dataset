This amount was used to swap for 44,000,000 Platypus LP-USD, and then to mint 41,700,000 $USP tokens for free. The $USP tokens then were swapped for various stablecoins.

The hack was made possible by a logical vulnerability that allowed the attacker to exploit the transfer function, which gave them twice the rewards if the sender and recipient were a pair.</p><p>The attacker exploited the vulnerability by obtaining a 1,400 WBNB flash loan before exchanging 1,000 WBNB for 10.5K BRA tokens. They then transferred all the acquired BRA tokens to the Pancakeswap pair. Next, they used the \"skim()\" function and invoked the BRA contract's transfer function to receive rewards. The \"skim()\" function acts as a recovery mechanism if the number of tokens supplied to a pair exceeds the two uint112 storage spaces for reserves.</p><p><br></p><p>In this case, the attacker provided the pair as the recipient address, and BRA reverted to the pair, resulting in the doubling of the BRA amount after a single skim. The attacker repeated this method 100 times, which led to a significant increase in the contract pair's BRA balance.</p><p><br></p><p>The attacker then returned 1.675K WBNB tokens and repaid the 1.4K WBNB token flash loan, which generated a profit of 675 WBNB that was sent to their address.

The root cause of the vulnerability was because the NUM token was incompatible with the Multichain, a cross-chain router protocol. The NUM token lacked a permit function required by the Router protocol, but it did have a default callback function which allowed forged signature to be passed in to trick the cross-chain bridge into transferring the user's assets. The attacker created a fake token using the attack contract which used $NUM as its underlying token, then called the anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit function of the Multi-Chain Router contract to drain 557,754.45000198 $NUM tokens from one of the victim users. This function should generally pass in token, and call the permit function of the underlying token for signature approval, before exchanging the token of the authorized user to the specified address. In this case, since the $NUM token contract didn’t have a permit function, but it did have a callback function, which means that when an attacker sent in a fake signature, the callback function would return normally, so the transaction wouldn't fail. Eventually, this allowed the $NUM token at the victim address to be transferred to the specified attack contract. The attacker then used Uniswap to convert the stolen $NUM tokens into $USDC and then into WETH. The attack was front-run by a bot, which paid the builder approximately 10 ETH out of the entire profit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker TX:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8a8145ab28b5d2a2e61d74c02c12350731f479b3175893de2014124f998bff32</p>",
