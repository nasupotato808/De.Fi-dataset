The attacker manipulated the liabilities array of a controlled account through a series of preparation transactions, doubling the value of the user's collateral assets. This manipulation allowed the attacker to bypass the health check when borrowing assets.

The breach was due to vulnerabilities within the Balancer-style CPMM pool contract, particularly faulty logic in the velocore__execute() function and issues with the fee rate calculation logic that allowed effectiveFee1e9 to exceed 100%. Additionally, there was a potential underflow issue during single-token withdrawals and a lack of caller verification in the velocore__execute() function. The attacker used funds from Tornado Cash, executed the exploit, bridged the funds through Across Bridge, and redeposited them back into Tornado Cash. While all volatile pools in Linea and zkSyncEra Velocore were affected, stable pools and the Telos Velocore pools were not impacted as the issue was mitigated beforehand. The Blade fork of Velocore, which uses a different pool structure, was also unaffected. The team acknowledged the critical assistance from Hexagate, Hypernative, and Ironblock in identifying and addressing the exploit. Further updates and a detailed post-mortem are forthcoming.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Final Fund Destination Address:&nbsp;</p><p>0xe4062fcade7ac0ed47ad794028967a2314ee02b3</p><p>Exploiter EOAs:</p><p>0x8cdc37ed79c5ef116b9dc2a53cb86acaca3716bf</p><p>0xd8c465ecd8c6f1a0c114890f1ef553f82e59d274</p><p>Exploiter Contracts:</p><p>0xed4e130f6f9e68918996f7e1e46a3306b3e12cec</p><p>0xb7f6354b2cfd3018b3261fbc63248a56a24ae91a</p><p>0xc030fba4b741b770f03e715c3a27d02c41fc9dae</p><p>0xf7f76b30a301524fe76508546B1e3762eF2B9267</p><p>Attack txs:</p><p>https://lineascan.build/tx/0xed11d5b013bf3296b1507da38b7bcb97845dd037d33d3d1b0c5e763889cdbed1</p><p>https://lineascan.build/tx/0x37434e674efc4e7cfeed7746095301ace5636028906fe548b786ead286e35eb0</p><p>https://explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x4156d73cadc18419220f5bcf10deb4d97a3d3f7533d63ba90daeabc5fd11ba17</p><p><br></p>",

The vulnerability resided in the depositToGasZipERC20 function within the GasZipFacet.sol contract. This function allowed the _swapData parameter to be passed directly to LibSwap.swap, which included a low-level call that could execute arbitrary functions. Since the attacker had control over _swap.callTo and _swap.callData, they were able to craft malicious calldata with transferFrom() calls. With sufficient token spending approval, the attacker executed unauthorized transferFrom() calls to siphon funds from the protocol. Li.Fi has advised users to revoke approvals for specific addresses and has disabled the affected smart contract facet to contain the exploit. This incident is particularly notable as it echoes a similar $600,000 loss in 2022 due to the same bug in the protocol’s swapping feature.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x7742ed59e9ecf1712bc4c6bdd0c526e903a7f2c8</p><p><br></p><p>Vulnerable contact</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xf28a352377663ca134bd27b582b1a9a4dad7e534#code</p><p><br></p><p>Attack tx:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd82fe84e63b1aa52e1ce540582ee0895ba4a71ec5e7a632a3faa1aff3e763873</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x65a92b189e4ae0b8a8a02cd59c5e9f6832586bd5167d41a24eb4f4d2ac692755</p>",

The attacker managed to drain the funds by first compromising the signers' Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and subsequently changing the implementation of the Multisig. The attack began with a specific transaction (Etherscan link), where the attacker executed a delegate call from the compromised multisig to a proprietary contract deployed eight days earlier. The delegate call data was 0x804e1f0a000000000000000000000000ef279c2ab14960aa319008cbea384b9f8ac35fc6, which modified the slot 0 of the multisig proxy to point to the new proprietary contract. Tools like evm.storage confirmed that before the attack, slot 0 contained the standard safe implementation, and afterward, it pointed to the attacker's contract. Further analysis showed that after the implementation modification, all transactions to the Safe Multisig redirected delegate calls to the new address, which simply transferred assets to the attacker.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0xd967113224c354600b3151e27aaba53e3034f372</p><p><br></p><p>Attack tx:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x48164d3adbab78c2cb9876f6e17f88e321097fcd14cadd57556866e4ef3e185d</p>",

The attacker initiated the attack by taking a flashloan and borrowing USDY tokens from Minterest's flashLoan function, which triggered their fallback function, allowing them to manipulate the market’s exchange rates. This manipulation resulted in a lower cash balance for the market. When Minterest's contract called the attacker's fallback function, the attacker converted USDY tokens to mUSD and reentered the Minterest contract via the lendRUSDY function, exploiting the modified exchange rate to receive excess mTokens. The attacker then withdrew the underlying tokens, causing Minterest to burn some mTokens but retain the excess. Repeating this process multiple times, the attacker accumulated an estimated $1.7 million in mTokens in the mUSDY market, which they used to borrow WETH and mETH, ultimately draining $1.4 million from the protocol. This exploit also led to the liquidation of many user positions within the mUSDY market.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x618f768af6291705eb13e0b2e96600b3851911d1</p><p>Funding by Tornado:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x99fa85d1549205f63aedc14a6878fc0357b26c7c6c0b69813ce86ff4b315eaee</p><p>Example of the Tornado deposit:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe14c67b2f107e352aca8a796dc2e07b9d32777cd37d913ba9762eed3364d2710</p>",

The attacker exploited this oversight to drain assets, including USDC stablecoin and ASTRO tokens, totaling around $4 million. In response, Terra implemented emergency measures, including halting the blockchain and coordinating with validators to apply a necessary patch.

In the first instance, the attacker used 59.9 ETH as collateral to borrow 1.18 WBTC.

This function accepted arbitrary external contract addresses for reward claims, which the attacker exploited by passing a malicious contract through the pair parameter. This contract manipulated the internal balances of DeltaPrime, deceiving the protocol into paying out additional rewards.
