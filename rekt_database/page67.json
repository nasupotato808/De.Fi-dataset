Borrowed assets are used to exploit Yearn Finance’s USDT pool vulnerability and mint a big amount of ycUSDT (~204 billion) and yUSDT (~33 trillion) tokens then swap them for various stablecoins worth 11,512,509 $USD. Another smaller attack took place during the exploit which affected Aave’s LendingPoolCoreV1 contract. Worth noticing that the exploiter repaid all users USDT positions in the Aave V1 protocol.

The protocol experienced a hack due to a price manipulation attack on the Optimism layer-two chain. The attacker deployed malicious smart contract with unverified source code, and then donated 200 $WBTC to inflate hWBTC's exchange rate so that even a tiny amount (2 wei) of $hWBTC could drain current lending pools. The attacker then borrows 500 $WBTC from Aave and deposited into the pool and borrowed funds from all pools because of the inflated price of $hWBTC. Consequently, 500 $WTBC was redeemed back for nothing, which caused the attacker contract being liquidated. This resulted in 6,701,157 $USD worth of cryptocurrency being drained from their lending pools. The hacker bridged over 1,034 $ETH valued at 2,180,000 $USD on the day of transfer along with other cryptocurrencies such as USDC and USDT via Multichain and swapped them for various tokens including DAI, FRAX, PAXG among others. 919,224 $USD worth of $sUSD and $SNX remains at the attackers original address at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x155da45d374a286d383839b1ef27567a15e67528</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transactions:</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/0x6e9ebcdebbabda04fa9f2e3bc21ea8b2e4fb4bf4f4670cb8483e2f0b2604f451</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io//tx/0x15096dc6a59cff26e0bd22eaf7e3a60125dcec687580383488b7b5dd2aceea93</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious contracts:</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x978d0ce23869ec666bfde9868a8514f3d2754982</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x284abd14f54125064b7bcc3b9be84931fa5c9aac</p><p>https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xd340f2208edbbbeca4fe4893d76eaaa5711e702b</p>",

The exploit was possible due to a vulnerable 'swap' function that allowed anyone to perform malicious swaps and&nbsp;</p><p>fully drain the pool.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Details of the Exploit</strong></p><p>Swapos is a DEX running on the Ethereum chain. The project offered decentralized trading with low fees. On the day Swapos V2 Contracts were deployed, a vulnerability was discovered in their 'swap' function which allowed an attacker to execute malicious swaps and fully drain all three pools, including SWP/WETH, USDC/WETH, USDC/WBTC. In total, <span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>464,026 $USD</span> worth of assets were stolen from these pools. Interestingly, the exploiter executed a transaction after a hack with a message reading \"safe\", suggesting they may be a whitehat hacker attempting to bring attention to this vulnerability rather than committing outright theft. Regardless of intent, funds are currently held within the attacker's contract.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker address:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x53fc4a4a638378b9b81393fbe0fa9a6de2323ebd</p><p><br></p><p>Malicious transactions:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x78edc292af51a93f89ac201a742bce9fa9c5d9a7007f034aa30535e35082d50a</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4c55ba0b403e63702a0358e66b5b20b79c3ff1d77804d4a887dc5c0d119f1966</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbe643ccdcae57181b9fef554d63029e0605b2e860172d442c37eaabffdb44575</p><p><br></p><p>Attacker message:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4c37d83fa16994ce09fcb2425b9dcad36feb5cea48366880be0828b01843f624</p><p><br></p><p><span style='color: rgb(65, 65, 65); font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none;'>Malicious c</span>ontract:</p><p>https://etherscan.io/address/0x2df07c054138bf29348f35a12a22550230bd1405</p>",

The root cause of the issue is due to the protocol's inability to handle flashloans of ERC677 tokens properly. The attacker used a flashloan to borrow the underlying token, which was then deposited into the protocol via a callback function controlled by the attacker. This resulted in lots of extra f tokens being minted. The borrowed token was then returned to the protocol via a flashloan callback, but lots of fTokens were left to the attacker, allowing them to redeem most of the cash in the lending pool. FilDA on other chains is not affected since the issue is only related to ERC677 tokens.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Block Data Reference</strong></p><p>Attacker Address: 0x4a9a0cC103199F67730bdC61337d192788858874</p><p>Money Laundering address: 0x93c3A8051b8ba814eB5FB22d655681720E6a4d74</p><p>Attacker contract: 0x00Ff915E663F4037D18B0C83575Ac8f3D4D05BC3</p>",
